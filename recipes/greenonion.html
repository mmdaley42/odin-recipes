        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Gradually add the boiling water, stirring with chopsticks or a fork until the mixture forms a shaggy dough.</li>
        <li>Add the cold water and knead the dough until smooth. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into four equal pieces. Roll each piece into a thin circle on a lightly floured surface.</li>
        <li>Brush each circle with vegetable oil, sprinkle with chopped green onions, and season with salt.</li>
        <li>Roll each circle into a log, then coil it into a spiral shape. Flatten gently with your hand.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat and add a little oil. Fry each pancake for about 2-3 minutes on each side until golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Remove from the skillet and let cool slightly before slicing into wedges. Serve warm with soy sauce or your favorite dipping sauce.</li>
